# Othello
This repository contains the program I developed to judiciously make moves in Othello by implementing iterative deepening with a weighted heuristic function and negamax with alpha-beta pruning. This program was developed for my junior year Artificial Intelligence class and can be played at othello.tjhsst.edu
